        <p>Hi there,</p>
      
        <P>I'm Jamie and welcome to my website, all 16BIT of it!</P>


        <p>Recently I found myself unemployed and unable to do the line of work I have been doing for years, and that’s carpet fitting. So I thought lets start again and try something new, which is why your seeing this website. I decided to take on a few courses at the ripe old age of 40 and dove head first into the unknown and started a level 2 in computer coding and level 2 in cyber security. 4 weeks ago I have never touched a line of code and was completely lost when reading about “strings, functions, variables, loops” ect and done what probably all coders do and started with “Hello World” fast forward 4 weeks and its now Jamie’s world……</p>

        <P>Here I would most likely bore a lot of you, and friends will take the P1$$ a little but this is to purely show off what I’m learning and hopefully one day all the Youtube videos, reading texts I don’t understand and hints from ChatGPT will turn into more and this becomes my new day to day job. Finger crossed…..</P>

        <P>So please have a look around and leave some feed back, good or bad and watch as this site and myself grow......</P>
